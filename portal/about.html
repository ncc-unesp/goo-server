    <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
    <HR>

<p>The São Paulo State University (UNESP) has built a distributed computational
infrastructure that is considered one of the largest multi-campus Grid
initiatives in Latin America, with computing resources distributed on distinct
campuses throughout the state. GridUNESP, as the project is known, is a
statewide, multipurpose Grid infrastructure that is providing reliable and
high-performing computational power to distinct research groups from several
areas of science and engineering, allowing them to access state-of-art data
processing and storage systems. GridUNESP is a long term project that intends to
leverage the scientific research at UNESP</p>.

<p>The project, deployed with the important support of US Open Science Grid,
contains a central cluster located in São Paulo city and seven secondary
clusters at different UNESP campuses. The central cluster is most appropriate
for running tightly coupled parallel applications using MPI and proprietary
parallel libraries, whereas the secondary clusters are more suitable for running
loosely coupled applications or near embarrassingly parallel computations. The
eight sites are interconnected through the KyaTera network, an R&E experimental
optical network provided by FAPESP in association with Telefonica Brazil, a
subsidiary of the Spanish company that provides fixed-line telecommunications
services in the state of São Paulo.</p>

<p>A formal partnership between UNESP and the Open Science Grid Consortium was
signed in 2009, which enabled GridUNESP to use the OSG middleware stack to
integrate its computational resources and share them with other R&E institutions
worldwide. The GridUNESP VO was created in December 2009 as the first Virtual
Organization outside U.S. It is a multipurpose VO, including projects from
different research fields, including Biology and Biophysics, Chemistry, Computer
Science, Geosciences, Materials Science, Meteorology, and Physics.</p>

<p>In three years of operation, GridUNESP resources have processed 4,5 million
jobs, accounting for almost 40 millions of cpu hours. The project
supports more than 40 research groups, with over two hundreds registered users
working on different areas. The technical support efforts
have been focused on adapting HPC software to grid-friendly workflows, and
nowadays GridUNESP successfully runs scientific applications like Crystal,
Dirac, GAMESS, Gaussian, Gromacs, and POY with MrBayes parallel (MPI-like)
support. Due to those efforts, the number of researchers interested in using the
infrastructure has been growing systematically since the system became
operational in January of 2010. There is a real demand for high-end
computational resources and for qualified technical support inside UNESP. The
utilization of resources by the users of the GridUNESP VO, represented by the
mean occupancy of computing resources along the year, evolved from 19% in 2010
to 53% in 2011 and achieved 74% in 2012.</p>

<h4>ABOUT UNESP</H4>
<hR>

<p>UNESP, acronym for Universidade Estadual Paulista (São Paulo State University), is the second largest university in Brazil, with distinguished achievements in teaching, research, and continuing education. UNESP is part of the state of São Paulo public higher education system, which also includes the University of São Paulo (USP) and the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). A prominent characteristic of UNESP is its decentralized and multi-campus structure, with 33 R&E units distributed on 23 campuses throughout the state. The institution has almost a thousand research groups in all major areas of knowledge, with international recognition in key areas such as nanotechnology, molecular biology, biotechnology and biomaterials, and high energy physics.</p>
